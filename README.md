# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project is an implementation of the shell created as the final project for the C code sprint at **ALX Africa**.

This is a shell written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
It is based on [the Thompson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell).

Our shell was built and tested on  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
- Final step: ENJOY!
